# LibGDX-Line-Extensions
LibGDX ShapeRenderer extension to draw dotted lines, real arcs & dotted arcs. 
The main drawback of shaperenderer is that we cannot add thickness to the drawings. 
So I have churned up a graphics based renderer to draw different types of lines & arcs using images instead of ShapeRenderer. 
This enables us to add thickness to our drawings.

Check out the result folder to see an image of the, well result.
